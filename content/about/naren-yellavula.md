Hi, I am Naren. I am currently working as a Staff Cloud Security Engineer in San Francisco Bay Area. I have more than a decade of experience in building Cloud Software, Tools, API and Micro-services. I transitioned myself into Cloud DevOps in 2021 to tackle the enterprise-level scaling challenges by using Cloud native Software like Kubernetes and it's ecosystem.

I worked with both startups and enterprises in my career. Outside work, I like to read books, do photography with my Olympus Micro four-thirds camera, blog here, and visit local libraries. I majorly use Python & Go for my official & leisure work, and currently exploring Rust & Zig for future use cases.

## Work

Few of the notable companies I worked previously:

<b>Citrix (United States & India)</b>

I was part of SDWAN team helping build Citrix Cloud Platform.

<b>Zalando (Germany)</b>

I worked for Tradebyte Software GmbH, a Zalando company to develop their cloud platform for delivering E-commerce products seamlessly to Channels.

<b>Dolby (United States)</b>

I am one of the Cloud Platform Engineers hired by Dolby to setup EKS-based clusters to host an array of services consumed by Dilby Media Cloud.

## Transition from App world to Infra

In 2021, I catapulted myself into the exciting world of Cloud-native software & Platform engineering which brought me eventually into CLoud & App Security. Before that, I was programming applications using Python, Django and Go.

You can find my current & past open-source GitHub projects here: [Naren Yellavula's Projects](../projects)

I also authored a couple of well-acclaimed tech books in Go. You can find them here: [Naren Yellavula's Books](../books)
