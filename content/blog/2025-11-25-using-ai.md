Since December 2022, I have experimented with AI for coding. Early tools were crude, requiring code to be copied and pasted between the chatbot and the editor. Eventually, platforms like GitHub Copilot emerged, providing AI code completion in editors such as VSCode. Coding in editors is very helpful and feels like pair programming with a colleague while working remotely. The difference is that instead of another human, a prediction engine (LLM) is on the other side.


In 2025, Vibe Coding is a trend for developing code that can be assembled into functioning software. As part of vibe coding, agentic coding (with tools like Claude Code, Codex, Amp CLI, etc.) is becoming increasingly popular among developers. I am lucky enough to have lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for the past three years and witnessed this AI coding revolution firsthand.

I mainly use AI in three different modes for developing software:

1. AI as a Co-pilot

2. AI as a Debugger

3. AI as a Time Saver

In this article, I will go through each mode and explain my observations on treating AI in each, talk about common pitfalls in AI coding and how to overcome them. I am not going into topics like: What should be your CLAUDE.md file ? etc. That is for some other time.

## AI as a Co-pilot
A co-pilot in a flight assists the captain with take-off and landing, monitors the weather, and communicates with flight controllers.

Similarly, AI as a co-pilot helps a developer share the workload for developing parts of the codebase and utilities. But as a captain, you need to make sure that the AI implementation has following:

1. Is output of acceptable quality ?

2. Does the output use existing paradigms & dependencies ?

3. Is output secure from vulnerabilities ?

4. Does output leads to a destructive operation ?

The current AI's capability is not great at considering the second and third-order consequences of an outcome. Therefore, one must always do that job as a captain and guide AI. This is a vital quality in working with AI as a co-pilot.

### Tips for reviewing AI work as a Co-pilot

Look for inefficient operations

Look for dangerous operations

Look for new dependencies

## AI as a Debugger

As a developer, AI is wonderful at debugging code or configuration files generated in unfamiliar domains.

Humans, while debugging, solve one problem at a time; therefore, they work sequentially, whereas AI can perform a forward pass and identify multiple issues in a single attempt. This is where AI delivers the greatest value. When you are stuck in tough situations, taking help from AI can unblock you quickly and also reveal other problems which you'll eventually face.

AI as a debugger also provides an opportunity to learn debugging skills from AI without spending too much time on actual debugging. I maintain a journal of debugged items every time I see AI spotting an issue and fixing it. Instead of rushing, I try to understand the root cause and absorb it completely before I move on.

## Tips while using AI as a debugger

Slow down

Understand the conditions that lead to failure

## AI as a Time Saver

AI offers many opportunities to optimize your daily workflows, which are slow to create but fast to abandon. For ex, you may need to switch your work laptop, reinstall the developer environment, or do the same thing N times (Creating Dockerfiles, GitHub Actions, Shell scripts, etc.). AI can easily do these repetitive tasks to save you time so that you can focus on other important stuff in your life. With the help of AI, I created a Docker image for an Ubuntu dev box with most of the important tools & packages, which would have taken me a lot of time previously.

AI can also save time understanding a given codebase, which used to take days when introduced to a new project. This use case is seriously underrated, but using agentic AI to add a project to the context and ask questions is a great value from AI.

What does AI do ?
---

Crafts Dockerfiles, Shell Scripts, or any other boring tasks that take effort to write but are easy to abandon

Understand large code bases.

How can you save time ?
---

Delegating boring tasks

Summarizing projects & documenting design

Finally, working with AI in these three modes will always keep you in the game, therefore retaining your skill in observing changes.

A few things to consider
There are a few things one must not forget while developing code with AI:

Always run sensitive operations in a containerized sandbox.

Never share personal information with AI (Easy to slip in debugging logs)

Reverse delegate tasks from AI to yourself to practice coding

Finally, I don’t use AI as a replacement for myself. It lacks business context and emotion, so it may lead me down the wrong path if it takes complete control.

One might think that in 2025, people will use AI in an advanced way, but remember that fundamental principles remain the same across all kinds of work. The rules I presented above are universal, irrespective of how powerful the AI gets in the future.
