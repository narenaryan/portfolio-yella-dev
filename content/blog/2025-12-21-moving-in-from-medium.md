Hi, I am transitioning myself from Medium to this website to create custom look and feel for my writings.

I used Medium extensively & tried substack, but I feel they are cookie-cutter solutions for all blogs. To maintain authenticity, I like to theme my website based on my custom design principles of minimalism & readability.

If you want to explore my past writings, please visit these blogs below:
